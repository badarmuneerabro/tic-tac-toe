# tic-tac-toe

This is a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game which is programmed using socket programming api in java,
and it uses some advance concepts of multithreading(Lock and Condition). This project can be simply
configured just by instantiating the objects properly(passing proper IP addresses as argument in constructor)
and calling execute method on server object.
